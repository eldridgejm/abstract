broadcast
=========

Never manually upload homeworks or lecture slides again.

*broadcast* is a static site generator designed specifically for making course webpages.
It integrates with [*publish*](https://github.com/eldridgejm/publish), so it is aware of
your course materials and when they should be released. Always forget to publish the
solutions? They're built and posted automatically the day after the homework is due (or
whenever you specify). Fixed a typo in the lecture slides? The new version is uploaded
automatically.
